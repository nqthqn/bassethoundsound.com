We specialize in high quality live sound for small venues and events like weddings and private parties. Beyond this we run a small project studio & creative space.

Our home base is Eugene, OR in the Pacific Northwest but we specialize in destination events and can travel easily from Northern California to the Seattle/Puget Sound area on the I-5 corridor.
